Virtualization is ubiquitous in cloud computing today. Its benefits are numerous and as a result the vast majority of
server hosting solutions today will run client code on virtual machines or containers instead of on bare metal machines.
This allows for efficient use of resources but poses a risk to the cloud provider as well as the customers. Although extensive
work has gone into hardening the technologies behind virtualization, misconfiguration can still result in a compromised
machine.

I have created a tool, which I call Canary, which will detect configuration errors fix them or alert the user of their presence.
This program can be used to evaluate whether a system is following security best practices and help the administrator
resolve simple issues without spending time investigating. Today, a system infrastructure specialist would use tools such
as Terraform to provision and deploy a distributed system. This tool can be used in conjunction with other tools like
this to automate the process of security auditing and cloud formation.
