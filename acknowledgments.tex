My appreciation goes to those who made this thesis possible.

To Dr. Guangming Xing, my thesis advisor. Without your direction and encouragement this thesis would not have been possible. Thank you for all your support from my time as an undergraduate to today.

To Dr. Michael Galloway. Your teaching and leadership through the years has brought me to where I am now.

To Dr. Qi Li. For patiently teaching and helping me grow.

And lastly to God, my friends, and my family. Who supported me and encouraged me throughout the years leading up to this point.
