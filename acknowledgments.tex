My appreciation goes to those who made this thesis possible.

To Dr. Guangming Xing, my thesis advisor. Without your direction and encouragement this thesis would not have been possible. Thank you for all your support from my time as an undergraduate and as a graduate. If not for you, I would not be where I am today.

To Dr. Michael Galloway. Your teaching and leadership through the years has been critical to my development as a software engineer. Thank you for your guidance, insight, and help.

To Dr. Qi Li. For patiently teaching and helping me grow. The knowledge I gained from you has been helpful to this day and it is due to your persistent explanation of these topics that I am able to apply it.

And also to God, my friends, and my family.
